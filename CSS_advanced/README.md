CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language, most notably HTML. CSS controls the visual styling and layout of web pages, dictating how HTML elements are displayed on various media like screens, print, or other devices.
Key aspects of CSS include:
Styling:
CSS allows control over aspects such as colors, fonts, text sizes, spacing, backgrounds, and element positioning.
Separation of Concerns:
It promotes the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making web development more organized and maintainable.
Cascading:
The "cascading" in CSS refers to how styles are applied. Styles can be inherited from parent elements to child elements, and rules are applied based on specificity, origin, and order, allowing for a hierarchical and predictable application of styles.
Rule-based Language:
CSS is a rule-based language where rulesets define styles to be applied to specific elements or groups of elements. A ruleset consists of a selector (identifying the elements to be styled) and a declaration block (containing one or more declarations). 
Declarations:
Each declaration within a declaration block consists of a property (e.g., color, font-size) and a value (e.g., blue, 16px).
Efficiency:
CSS can control the layout and styling of multiple web pages from a single stylesheet, saving time and effort in web development and design.
